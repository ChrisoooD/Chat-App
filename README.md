This is a video tutorial about creating a chatting software using chatengine.io by Javascript mastery. 

This chatting software is capable of adding users and creating chat groups for multiple people. By clicking the "+" once logged in, you will be able to create new chats and add new persons. Since we are using the free plan, there might be a 1 second delay in sending messages. Additionally, you can only have up to 25 accounts at the same time. We already have some users created with the information in the login-credential.txt. admin is the administrator of these chats and others are just users.
